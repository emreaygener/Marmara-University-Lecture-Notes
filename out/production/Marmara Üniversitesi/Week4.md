# Inheritence

The child component automatically inherits parents constructor even if we don't use super() in the constructor. We can even call a method that parent have without calling super() in constructor as super.someMethod().

# Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the ability to use a common interface for multiple forms (data types). It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It is the ability to redefine methods for derived classes.
