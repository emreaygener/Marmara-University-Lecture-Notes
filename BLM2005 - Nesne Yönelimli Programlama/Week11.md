# Design Patterns

- Design patterns are general solutions to common problems that occur in software design.

## Creational Design Patterns

- Creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

#### Singleton Pattern S覺navda var

- Singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns in Java. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.

#### Factory Pattern S覺navda var

- Factory pattern is one of the most used design patterns in Java. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.

#### Abstract Factory Pattern

- Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories. This factory is also called as factory of factories.

#### Builder Pattern

- Builder pattern builds a complex object using simple objects and using a step by step approach.

#### Prototype Pattern

- Prototype pattern refers to creating duplicate object while keeping performance in mind. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.

#### Object Pool Pattern

- Object Pool Pattern says that " to reuse the object that are expensive to create".

#### Factory Method Pattern

- Factory Method Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class for creating an object but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

#### Lazy Initialization Pattern

- Lazy Initialization Holder idiom is a way to implement lazy initialization in a thread-safe manner in Java.

#### Dependency Injection Pattern

- Dependency Injection Pattern is a design pattern that removes the dependency from the programming code so that it can be easy to manage and test.

## Structural Design Patterns

- Structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

#### Adapter Pattern S覺navda var

- Adapter pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern combines the capability of two independent interfaces.

#### Bridge Pattern

- Bridge is used when we need to decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

#### Composite Pattern

- Composite pattern is used where we need to treat a group of objects in similar way as a single object.

#### Decorator Pattern

- Decorator pattern allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure.

#### Facade Pattern

- Facade pattern hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface to the client using which the client can access the system.

#### Flyweight Pattern

- Flyweight pattern is primarily used to reduce the number of objects created and to decrease memory footprint and increase performance.

#### Proxy Pattern

- Proxy means an object representing another object.

#### Filter Pattern

- Filter pattern or Criteria pattern is a design pattern that enables developers to filter a set of objects using different criteria and chaining them in a decoupled way through logical operations.

#### Composite Entity Pattern

- Composite Entity pattern is used in EJB persistence mechanism. A Composite entity is an EJB entity bean which represents a graph of objects.

## Behavioral Design Patterns

- Behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns.

#### Chain of Responsibility Pattern

- Chain of responsibility pattern is used to achieve loose coupling in software design where a request from the client is passed to a chain of objects to process them.

#### Command Pattern

- Command pattern is a data driven design pattern and falls under behavioral pattern category.

#### Interpreter Pattern

- Interpreter pattern provides a way to evaluate language grammar or expression.

#### Iterator Pattern S覺navda var

- Iterator pattern is very commonly used design pattern in Java and .Net programming environment.

#### Mediator Pattern

- Mediator pattern is used to reduce communication complexity between multiple objects or classes.

#### Memento Pattern

- Memento pattern is used to restore state of an object to a previous state.

#### Observer Pattern

- Observer pattern is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified, its depenedent objects are to be notified automatically.

#### State Pattern

- In State pattern a class behavior changes based on its state.

#### Null Object Pattern

- Null object pattern is used to provide a default behavior to an object.

#### Strategy Pattern

- Strategy pattern is used when we have multiple algorithm for a specific task and client decides the actual implementation to be used at runtime.

#### Template Pattern

- Template pattern is used to create a method stub and deferring some of the steps of implementation to the subclasses.

#### Visitor Pattern

- Visitor pattern is used when we have to perform an operation on a group of similar kind of objects.

#### Business Delegate Pattern

- Business Delegate Pattern is used to decouple presentation tier and business tier.

#### Composite Entity Pattern

- Composite Entity pattern is used in EJB persistence mechanism. A Composite entity is an EJB entity bean which represents a graph of objects.

#### Data Access Object Pattern

- Data Access Object Pattern or DAO pattern is used to separate low level data accessing API or operations from high level business services.

#### Front Controller Pattern

- Front Controller pattern is used to provide a centralized request handling mechanism so that all requests will be handled by a single handler.
